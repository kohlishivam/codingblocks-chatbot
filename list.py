a=['250','230','123']# list is  just like an array in c
a=a + ['ghgh']# it is non homogeneous as numbers and alphabets both can be members of the list
a.append(78)#a function used to add a last element to the list
print a

a=('ab','cd','fg')#it is a tuple 
a= a + ('34',)#adding alement to tuple
print a 
#diff btw tuple and a list is that item assignment to  (a[0]) is not supported in tuple
